#theguncount

This is a Twitter Bot project created by Kenneth Nguyen and Justin Dang. Incentivized by the Uvalde, Texas shooting and dozens more of the like, the @guncount bot automatically notifies the public whenever a mass shooting occurs in real time, within hours. Each tweet contains relevant information, including death toll, injured, location, date, and source.
